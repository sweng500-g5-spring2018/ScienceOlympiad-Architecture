# ScienceOlympiad-Architecture
Documentation for Science Olympiad System

## Purpose

##### PSU Capstone Experience
The purpose of this application was to build a Software Product with an agile approach such that we could 
build a functional "production ready" Minimal Viable Product.  The idea was to come up with an idea for a product to build
from scratch; in this case, automating the Science Olympiad process by providing a web application for PSU.  The goal was 
to push ourselves to learn new technologies, see the product through end-to-end, while completing sets of deliverables 
every 2-3 weeks which could then be demoed at the end of each sprint.  We also decided to build out a full CI/CD pipeline
for capturing code changes, automating our test suites, and deploying the latest code to the publicly accessible web.

##### Client Facing UI
For this web application, we also a UI for allowing users of the application to interface with the API and facilitate 
all of their Science Olympiad needs:

##### Backend API
For this web application, we built an API managing our authentication/authorization of users and managing our 
CRUD operations to/from MongoDB.
